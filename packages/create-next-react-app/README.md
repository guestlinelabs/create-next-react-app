# create-next-react-app

We have not created the installer for creating Next React Apps yet. But you can still create it using [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To do so:

#### 1. Install Create React App

```
npm i -g create-react-app
```

#### 2. create your new project

With the terminal, go in the folder where you want to create your project - e.g. `~/projects`. And run:

```
create-react-app my-new-project --scripts-version next-react-app-scripts
```
